## High-Level Plan

**AgentCult: Emergent Religious Economies** — Autonomous AI cult leaders recruit followers via prophecies and bribes, build $CULT token treasuries, then raid and sacrifice rival cults' funds. All on Monad blockchain.

### Target Bounties

| Track                    | Prize                                           | Requirements                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent+Token**          | $10K/winner (10 winners) + $40K liquidity boost | Deploy token on nad.fun + agent interacts with token      |
| **Religious Persuasion** | $10K                                            | AI prophets generating predictions & converting followers |
| **Gaming Arena**         | $10K                                            | Raid mechanics with treasury wagering & leaderboards      |

| **Agent reputation system** | §8.2 | ✅ Implemented | `registerAgent()`, `updateReputation()`, `deactivateAgent()` in CultRegistry.sol with `AgentIdentity` struct |
| **Anti-exploit mechanisms** | §8.3 | ✅ Implemented | `minimumStake` anti-sybil in CultRegistry + **commit-reveal voting** (`commitVote()`/`revealVote()`) in GovernanceEngine.sol — prevents front-running of votes |

## Environment Requirements

```env
# .env (root)
PRIVATE_KEY=           # Deployer/agent wallet private key (without 0x)
MONAD_TESTNET_RPC=     # defaults to https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
XAI_API_KEY=           # Grok/xAI API key from console.x.ai
CULT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS= # Filled after: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network monad_testnet
CULT_TOKEN_ADDRESS=    # Filled after nad.fun token creation (or auto-created by orchestrator)
FAITH_STAKING_ADDRESS= # Filled after deployment
AGENT_API_PORT=        # defaults to 3001

# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=   # defaults to http://localhost:3001
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Monad testnet MON tokens from https://faucet.monad.xyz
- xAI API key from https://console.x.ai

---

## What To Do Next (Priority Order)

### 🔴 P0 — Must-do before submission (Feb 14)

1. **Deploy contracts to Monad testnet**

   ```bash
   # Fill .env with PRIVATE_KEY, get MON from faucet
   cd contracts && npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network monadTestnet
<<<<<<< HEAD
   # Deploys: CultRegistry → FaithStaking → GovernanceEngine → SocialGraph → EconomyEngine
   # Copy all 5 deployed addresses to .env
=======
   # Copy deployed addresses to .env: CULT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS + FAITH_STAKING_ADDRESS
>>>>>>> 8500a7ce99f53a5dac5261e06d78e2bbe93a8481
   ```

2. **Test end-to-end with real xAI API key**

   ```bash
   cd agent && npm run dev
   # Verify: agents register on-chain, prophecies recorded, raids resolved
   # $CULT token auto-created on nad.fun during bootstrap (if balance > 0.02 MON)
   ```

3. **Deploy frontend to Vercel**

   ```bash
   cd frontend && npx vercel --prod
   # Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL env var to your agent API URL
   ```

4. **Record 3-minute demo video** — Show agents running, prophecies appearing, raid animation

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 🟡 P1 — High-impact polish (if time permits)

5. ~~**FaithStaking frontend UI**~~ ✅ Done — StakingPanel.tsx with real wallet integration
6. ~~**TreasuryChart component**~~ ✅ Done — Time-series line chart with 60-snapshot rolling window
7. ~~**Persuasion formula**~~ ✅ Done — Design doc formula replaces random conversion count

### 🟢 P2 — Stretch goals (post-hackathon)

8. ~~**Bribery mechanics**~~ ✅ Done
9. ~~**Leadership voting / coups**~~ ✅ Done — `proposeCoup()` with power threshold
10. ~~**Joint alliance raids**~~ ✅ Done — `initiateJointRaid()` with proportional spoils
11. ~~**Private encrypted messaging**~~ ✅ Done — whisper + propaganda blitz + **leaking** + **selective disclosure**
12. ~~**Selective balance visibility**~~ ✅ Done
13. ~~**Belief evolution**~~ ✅ Done — zealotry, mysticism, pragmatism, adaptability
14. **Pyth Network oracle** — Replace simulated prophecy resolution with real price oracle
=======
### 🟢 P2 — Nice-to-have polish (stretch goals)

5. **TreasuryChart component** — Chart.js/recharts time-series of treasury over raids
6. **FaithStaking frontend UI** — Staking panel on cult detail page
7. **Agent prompt mutation** — Evolve personality based on win/loss record

## Decision Log

<<<<<<< HEAD
| Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| 5 Solidity contracts (not design doc's 8) | CultRegistry covers core state. GovernanceEngine, FaithStaking, EconomyEngine, SocialGraph cover the critical modules. Trading, Communication Permissions, and Event Emitter contracts from design doc skipped — handled off-chain. |
| Deploy script deploys all 5 in dependency order | CultRegistry → FaithStaking(registry) → GovernanceEngine(registry) → SocialGraph → EconomyEngine. Single script, no manual steps. |
| Prophecy resolution is simulated | No time to integrate Pyth Network oracle. Market-based (ETH price movement) but using CoinGecko with fallback, not a true on-chain oracle. |
| Follower conversion count is random 1–3 | PersuasionService calls joinCult() on-chain but picks random count. Design doc has charisma/persuasion formula — skipped for speed. |
| Grok (xAI) for LLM | OpenAI-compatible SDK, fast responses, good for creative/weird prophecy text. All LLM calls have try/catch with fallback responses. |
| GovernanceService has on-chain + off-chain dual mode | Tries GovernanceEngine contract first, falls back to local vote tally if contract unavailable. Ensures agents keep running even without governance contract deployed. |
| EvolutionService mutates traits, not beliefs | Design doc §6.2 wants full belief evolution. We implemented aggression/confidence/diplomacy mutation based on performance, which modifies system prompts dynamically. Core ideology stays static. |
| In-memory state store (no database) | Hackathon MVP. State resets on agent restart. MemoryService caps at 100 entries. Acceptable for demo. |
| Wallet connect added to frontend | useWallet hook with MetaMask + auto Monad chain switch. Was originally planned to skip — implemented for demo polish. |
| Bribery / leadership coups not implemented | ~~Design doc §3.3 has full spec. Skipped.~~ **NOW IMPLEMENTED** — `proposeCoup()` on-chain + `attemptCoup()` in GovernanceService. Power threshold: instigator must have 1.5× leader power. 5-min cooldown. |
| All agent services are real, not stubs | Audit confirmed: 30/30 files are full implementations. PersuasionService now uses design doc formula. |
| Joint raid uses struct params | RaidEngine.sol `initiateJointRaid()` accepts `JointRaidParams calldata` struct to avoid EVM stack-too-deep limit (12 params → 1 struct). |
| Commit-reveal voting for anti-front-running | GovernanceEngine.sol splits voting period at midpoint: first half commit (hash), second half reveal (values). Prevents copying other voters' choices. |
| Conversation leaking as information warfare | CommunicationService.ts `leakConversation()` exposes private whispers publicly, damages trust between the two parties. `selectiveDisclose()` shares intel with a third party strategically. |
| StakingPanel dual-mode (wallet + simulated) | Real MetaMask integration via ethers.js BrowserProvider when wallet connected + NEXT_PUBLIC_FAITH_STAKING_ADDRESS set. Falls back to simulated staking for demo without wallet. |
| TreasuryChart uses SVG mini-charts | No external charting library needed — pure SVG polyline/polygon with gradient fill. 60-snapshot rolling window at 5s polling interval (~5 minutes of history). |
=======
| Decision                                       | Rationale                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single CultRegistry.sol instead of 4 contracts | Faster to build, deploy, and debug. All state in one place. Judges care about working demo, not contract count. |
| Prophecy resolution is simulated               | No time to integrate Pyth Network oracle. Random 60% correct rate creates drama for demo.                       |
| Follower conversion is simulated               | On-chain recording of each follower join would cost gas. Tracked in-memory, synced to API.                      |
| Grok (xAI) for LLM                             | OpenAI-compatible SDK, fast responses, good for creative/weird prophecy text.                                   |
| No wallet connect in frontend                  | Time constraint. Frontend is dashboard-only — all interactions happen through agents.                           |
| In-memory state store (no database)            | Hackathon MVP. State resets on agent restart. Acceptable for demo.                                              |
