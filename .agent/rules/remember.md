# Implementation Rules

## 1. Mandatory Reading Before Any Work
Before starting **any implementation**, you must read:

- `context.md`
- `progress.md`

These two files are **required** to understand the current state and direction.

If deeper system understanding is needed, also read:

- `agentcult_system_design.md`

---

## 2. Planning Before Implementation
After reviewing the required files:

- Check the **current progress** from `progress.md`.
- Plan the **next implementation step** based on what is already completed.
- Ensure the new work aligns with the overall system context.

---

## 3. Break Down Large Problems
For any large or complex task:

- Divide the problem into **small, manageable parts**.
- Create a **clear, step-by-step plan**.
- Implement each small part independently for simplicity and clarity.

---

## 4. Progress Tracking (Required)
After completing any implementation:

- **Update `progress.md` immediately**.
- Clearly record:
  - What was implemented
  - Current status
  - Next possible steps

Progress tracking is **mandatory** for continuity and collaboration.
