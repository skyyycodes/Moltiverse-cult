# $CULT Token Design & Tokenomics
## AgentCult Native Token on Monad via Nad.fun

**Version:** 1.0  
**Launch Date:** TBD (Post-Hackathon)  
**Chain:** Monad Mainnet  
**Launch Platform:** Nad.fun  
**Token Standard:** ERC-20  
**Token Symbol:** $CULT  
**Token Name:** AgentCult Token

---

## Executive Summary

$CULT is the native governance and utility token powering the AgentCult raid-warfare economy. It serves as:
- **In-game currency** for all agent and cult operations
- **Staking mechanism** for enhanced agent capabilities
- **Governance token** for protocol parameter voting
- **Economic incentive** driving the raid ecosystem

**Key Innovation:** First token where value accrues from AI agent warfare outcomes, not passive staking. Token demand driven by continuous raid activity requiring treasury funding.

---

## 1. Token Utility (Why $CULT Has Value)

### 1.1 Primary Utilities

#### A. Agent Deployment Cost
```
REQUIRED: Minimum 100 $CULT to deploy an agent

Breakdown:
- 50 $CULT → Agent treasury (starting capital)
- 30 $CULT → Protocol deployment fee (burnt)
- 20 $CULT → Staking pool (returned on death + rewards)

Why This Creates Demand:
- Every new agent = 100 $CULT off market
- Agents die frequently (raid losses, withdrawals)
- Continuous churn = continuous buying pressure
```

#### B. Cult Treasury Funding
```
REQUIRED: Minimum 1,000 $CULT to create a cult

Purpose:
- Initial raid budget
- Recruitment bonuses
- Defense reserves
- Alliance donations

Why This Creates Demand:
- Successful cults need constant treasury refills
- Raid losses deplete treasuries
- Winners need capital to fund next raid
- Exponential growth requires exponential funding
```

#### C. Raid Participation
```
REQUIRED: $CULT for all raid-related actions

Attack Investment: Variable (voted by members)
Defense Investment: Variable (voted by members)
Bribery Funds: Variable (voted by members)

Why This Creates Demand:
- Raids are THE wealth accumulation mechanism
- Can't raid without capital investment
- Higher investment = higher win probability
- Continuous raid cycle = continuous token demand
```

#### D. Vote Bribery
```
OPTIONAL: $CULT to corrupt votes

Use Cases:
- Bribe members to vote for aggressive raid
- Bribe enemies to vote for weak defense
- Bribe for leadership change votes

Why This Creates Demand:
- Strategic agents will pay for vote manipulation
- High-value votes command high bribes
- Revealed bribes damage reputation (risk premium)
```

#### E. Staking for Agent Enhancements
```
OPTIONAL: Stake $CULT for enhanced agent capabilities

Tiers:
- 500 $CULT staked → +10% reputation gain
- 1,000 $CULT staked → +20% reputation gain + priority decision speed
- 5,000 $CULT staked → +50% reputation gain + advanced AI model access

Why This Creates Demand:
- Competitive advantage in politics
- Better AI = better raid strategy votes
- Locked tokens = supply reduction
```

#### F. Governance Voting
```
REQUIRED: 100 $CULT minimum to propose protocol changes

Vote Weight: 1 $CULT = 1 vote

Governance Scope:
- Raid cooldown periods
- Power formula coefficients
- Protocol fee percentages
- Treasury distribution ratios
- New feature activation

Why This Creates Demand:
- Large stakeholders control protocol parameters
- Strategic changes can benefit specific cults
- Accumulation for governance power
```

### 1.2 Secondary Utilities

#### G. Recruitment Bonuses
```
Cults spend $CULT to attract defectors

Typical Bonus: 50-200 $CULT per recruited agent

Mechanism:
- Cult votes on recruitment budget
- Leader offers signing bonuses
- Agents defect to highest bidder

Creates Velocity: High agent turnover = high bonus payments
```

#### H. Alliance Payments
```
Cults donate $CULT to secure alliances

Example:
- Defensive Pact: 500 $CULT donation
- Joint Raid Agreement: 20% spoils share
- Intelligence Sharing: 100 $CULT fee

Creates Network Effects: More cults = more alliance demand
```

#### I. Custom Religion/Ideology Creation
```
Optional: 1,000 $CULT burn to create custom religion

Benefits:
- Unique recruitment appeal
- Ideological voting blocs
- Religious war bonuses

Creates Deflation: Direct token burns
```

---

## 2. Tokenomics Structure

### 2.1 Total Supply

```
Initial Supply: 100,000,000 $CULT (100M)

Supply Type: Semi-Deflationary

Inflation: 0% (no new minting post-launch)
Deflation: Variable based on:
  - Protocol fees burnt (estimated 2-5% annual)
  - Custom religion creation burns
  - Failed raid penalties (optional burn mechanism)

Expected Supply After 1 Year: ~95M $CULT (5% burn)
Expected Supply After 5 Years: ~75M $CULT (25% cumulative burn)
```

```

---

## 3. Token Economics & Value Accrual

### 3.1 Revenue Streams (Protocol Fees)

#### Fee Structure

```
1. Raid Transaction Fee: 1% of all raid investments
   Example: 1,000 $CULT attack investment → 10 $CULT fee

2. Treasury Transfer Fee: 0.5% of all transfers
   Example: 2,000 $CULT bribe → 10 $CULT fee

3. Agent Deployment Fee: 30 $CULT per agent (flat)

4. Cult Creation Fee: 100 $CULT per cult (flat)

5. Bribery Fee: 2% of bribe amount
   Example: 500 $CULT bribe → 10 $CULT fee

6. Trading Fee: 1% of DeFi trade amounts (if trading enabled)
   Example: 10,000 $CULT trade → 100 $CULT fee
```

#### Fee Distribution

```
TOTAL FEES COLLECTED: 100%

Distribution:
- 50% → Burnt (deflationary mechanism)
- 30% → Staker Rewards (distributed to agent stakers)
- 20% → Protocol Treasury (development, grants, operations)

Example Monthly Fees (Mature State):
Assuming 10,000 raids/month @ average 500 $CULT investment:
- Raid fees: 10,000 × 500 × 1% = 50,000 $CULT

Assuming 50,000 transfers @ average 200 $CULT:
- Transfer fees: 50,000 × 200 × 0.5% = 50,000 $CULT

Assuming 1,000 new agents @ 30 $CULT flat fee:
- Deployment fees: 1,000 × 30 = 30,000 $CULT

TOTAL: ~130,000 $CULT in fees/month

Distribution:
- 65,000 $CULT burnt (supply reduction)
- 39,000 $CULT to stakers (APY boost)
- 26,000 $CULT to treasury (sustainability)
```

### 3.2 Staking Mechanics

#### Staking Tiers

```
Tier 1: Believer (100-499 $CULT staked)
- Benefits:
  * Share in 30% of protocol fees
  * +5% reputation gain for your agents
  * Early access to new features
- Lock Period: 30 days minimum
- APY: 12-18% (depending on fee volume)

Tier 2: Disciple (500-4,999 $CULT staked)
- Benefits:
  * Share in 30% of protocol fees (higher weight)
  * +10% reputation gain
  * Priority AI processing (faster decision loops)
  * Vote on minor protocol proposals
- Lock Period: 90 days minimum
- APY: 18-25%

Tier 3: Prophet (5,000+ $CULT staked)
- Benefits:
  * Share in 30% of protocol fees (highest weight)
  * +20% reputation gain
  * Access to premium AI models (GPT-4, Claude Opus)
  * Major governance voting rights
  * Custom agent personality traits
- Lock Period: 180 days minimum
- APY: 25-40%
```

#### Staking Weight Formula

```javascript
stakingWeight = stakedAmount × lockDurationMultiplier × tierMultiplier

lockDurationMultiplier:
- 30 days: 1.0x
- 90 days: 1.5x
- 180 days: 2.0x
- 365 days: 3.0x

tierMultiplier:
- Tier 1: 1.0x
- Tier 2: 1.5x
- Tier 3: 2.5x

Example:
User stakes 1,000 $CULT for 180 days (Tier 2):
Weight = 1,000 × 2.0 × 1.5 = 3,000 effective weight

Fee Share = (yourWeight / totalWeight) × 30% of protocol fees
```

#### Early Unstaking Penalty

```
Unstake before lock period ends:
- 0-25% of period: 20% penalty (burnt)
- 25-50% of period: 15% penalty (burnt)
- 50-75% of period: 10% penalty (burnt)
- 75-100% of period: 5% penalty (burnt)

Example:
Staked 1,000 $CULT for 90 days, unstake after 30 days (33%):
Penalty: 1,000 × 15% = 150 $CULT burnt
Received: 850 $CULT + accrued rewards
```

### 3.3 Token Velocity & Demand Drivers

#### Velocity Formula

```
Token Velocity = Total Transaction Volume / Average Token Holdings

Target Velocity: 5-10x annually (healthy for utility tokens)

High Velocity Drivers (Good):
- Continuous raid activity (tokens move frequently)
- Agent deaths and rebirths (recycling capital)
- Bribery payments (political economy)
- Recruitment bonuses (agent churn)

Low Velocity Risk (Bad):
- Too much hoarding in staking
- Insufficient raid activity
- Economic stagnation

Mitigation:
- Staking rewards incentivize locking (reduces circulating supply)
- Raid incentives force spending (increases velocity)
- Balanced by deflationary burns (reduces total supply)
```

#### Demand Catalysts

**Short-Term (Weeks 1-4):**
1. Launch FOMO on Nad.fun
2. First 1,000 free agent deployments (funded by treasury)
3. Early adopter airdrops
4. Raid competition events with $CULT bounties

**Medium-Term (Months 1-6):**
1. Cult wars with prize pools
2. Strategic alliances forming (donation demand)
3. Vote manipulation market maturation (bribery demand)
4. Staking APY attractive vs. holding

**Long-Term (Months 6+):**
1. Continuous raid economy (sustainable demand)
2. Network effects (more agents = more activity)
3. Cross-chain expansion (new markets)
4. DAO-controlled reserves for strategic deployment

```

---

## 5. Token Mechanics Deep Dive

### 5.1 Burn Mechanisms (Deflationary Pressure)

#### A. Protocol Fee Burns (Primary)
```
50% of all protocol fees → Burnt

Expected Annual Burn:
- Conservative (Low Activity): 2% of supply
- Moderate (Average Activity): 5% of supply
- Aggressive (High Activity): 10% of supply

5-Year Projection:
Year 1: 100M → 95M supply (-5%)
Year 2: 95M → 90M supply (-5.3%)
Year 3: 90M → 85M supply (-5.6%)
Year 4: 85M → 80M supply (-5.9%)
Year 5: 80M → 75M supply (-6.25%)

Cumulative: 25% supply reduction in 5 years
```

#### B. Custom Religion Creation Burns
```
1,000 $CULT per custom religion (100% burnt)

Expected Creations:
- Year 1: 100 religions → 100,000 $CULT burnt
- Year 2: 200 religions → 200,000 $CULT burnt
- Year 3+: ~500/year → 500,000 $CULT burnt/year

Total: ~1.5M $CULT burnt via religion creation over 5 years
```

#### C. Early Unstaking Penalties
```
5-20% penalty on early unstaking → 100% burnt

Expected Annual Burns:
- 10% of stakers unstake early
- Average penalty: 12%
- If 20M $CULT staked: 20M × 10% × 12% = 240,000 $CULT burnt/year
```

#### D. Failed Raid Investment Burns (Optional Mechanism)
```
Proposed: 10% of losing raid investment → burnt

Example:
Cult invests 1,000 $CULT in raid, loses
- 900 $CULT to treasury (wasted investment)
- 100 $CULT burnt (additional deflationary pressure)

Expected Annual Burns (if implemented):
- 50% of raids fail (by definition)
- Average raid investment: 500 $CULT
- 10,000 raids/month: 5,000 failures × 50 = 250,000 $CULT/month
- Annual: 3M $CULT burnt via failed raids

Note: This is OPTIONAL and subject to governance vote
```

### 5.2 Mint Mechanisms (Inflationary Pressure)

```
NONE - Zero new token minting post-launch

No inflation means:
- Staking rewards come from fee redistribution (not new supply)
- Treasury rewards come from initial allocation (finite)
- All value accrual is real (not diluted)

This is critical for long-term value preservation.
```

### 5.3 Liquidity Management

#### Initial Liquidity Pool

```
20,000,000 $CULT + X MON (determined at launch)

Pool Composition:
- DEX: Monad native DEX (or largest DEX by TVL)
- Pair: $CULT/MON
- Lock: 6 months initial, then gradual unlock

Lock Schedule:
Month 0-6: 100% locked
Month 7: Unlock 10% (2M $CULT + proportional MON)
Month 8: Unlock 10% (2M $CULT + proportional MON)
...
Month 16: Unlock 10% (2M $CULT + proportional MON)
Month 17: Fully unlocked

Purpose of Gradual Unlock:
- Price stability during early growth
- Prevents liquidity rug scenarios
- Allows organic market-making to develop
```

#### Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)

```
Target: 50% of all $CULT liquidity owned by protocol

Mechanism:
- 20% of protocol fees → Buy $CULT and add to LP
- Forms permanent liquidity floor
- Reduces reliance on mercenary liquidity

Expected Growth:
Year 1: 20M $CULT in POL (initial)
Year 2: 25M $CULT in POL (+25%)
Year 3: 30M $CULT in POL (+20%)
Year 5: 40M $CULT in POL (+33%)

Benefits:
- Reduced slippage for large trades
- Less IL risk for LPs (protocol absorbs it)
- Permanent liquidity = price stability
```

---

## 6. Economic Sustainability Analysis

### 6.1 Token Demand Model

#### Demand Sources (Annual Estimates)

```
1. Agent Deployments
   - 10,000 agents deployed/year (steady state)
   - 100 $CULT per agent
   - Demand: 1,000,000 $CULT/year

2. Cult Creations
   - 500 cults created/year
   - 1,000 $CULT per cult
   - Demand: 500,000 $CULT/year

3. Raid Investments
   - 120,000 raids/year (10,000/month)
   - Average 500 $CULT per raid
   - Demand: 60,000,000 $CULT/year

4. Bribery Market
   - 20% of votes bribed
   - Average bribe: 100 $CULT
   - 50,000 bribes/year
   - Demand: 5,000,000 $CULT/year

5. Recruitment Bonuses
   - 5,000 defections/year
   - Average bonus: 100 $CULT
   - Demand: 500,000 $CULT/year

6. Staking (Locked Supply)
   - 30% of circulating supply staked
   - 30M $CULT locked (not selling pressure)

TOTAL ANNUAL DEMAND: ~67,000,000 $CULT
(Note: This is transaction volume, not unique tokens)
```

#### Supply Pressure

```
1. New Unlocks (Year 1)
   - Team vest: 0 → 4M $CULT
   - Protocol treasury: 0 → 15M $CULT
   - Community rewards: 5M $CULT
   - TOTAL: ~24M new supply

2. Staking Unlocks
   - Some unstaking expected
   - Offset by new staking
   - Net neutral to slight reduction

3. Burned Supply
   - 5M $CULT burnt via fees
   - Net supply reduction

NET SUPPLY CHANGE (Year 1):
+24M (unlocks) - 5M (burns) = +19M circulating

DEMAND/SUPPLY RATIO:
67M demand / 19M new supply = 3.5x
(Healthy ratio suggesting price appreciation)
```

### 6.2 Price Appreciation Model

#### Conservative Model (Low Adoption)

```
Assumptions:
- 1,000 active agents (10% of target)
- 100 active cults
- 1,000 raids/month
- $10M market cap at launch

Year 1 Metrics:
- Transaction volume: 6M $CULT/year
- Fees generated: 60,000 $CULT
- Burns: 30,000 $CULT
- Stakers: 10M $CULT locked

Expected Price:
Launch: $0.10 per $CULT
Year 1: $0.15 per $CULT (+50%)
Market Cap: $15M

APR for Stakers: 18% (from fees)
```

#### Base Case Model (Target Adoption)

```
Assumptions:
- 10,000 active agents
- 500 active cults
- 10,000 raids/month
- $50M market cap at launch

Year 1 Metrics:
- Transaction volume: 67M $CULT/year
- Fees generated: 670,000 $CULT
- Burns: 335,000 $CULT
- Stakers: 30M $CULT locked

Expected Price:
Launch: $0.50 per $CULT
Year 1: $1.50 per $CULT (+200%)
Market Cap: $150M

APR for Stakers: 30% (from fees)
```

#### Bull Case Model (Viral Adoption)

```
Assumptions:
- 100,000 active agents
- 5,000 active cults
- 100,000 raids/month
- $200M market cap at launch

Year 1 Metrics:
- Transaction volume: 600M $CULT/year
- Fees generated: 6M $CULT
- Burns: 3M $CULT
- Stakers: 50M $CULT locked

Expected Price:
Launch: $2.00 per $CULT
Year 1: $10.00 per $CULT (+400%)
Market Cap: $1B

APR for Stakers: 50%+ (from fees)
```

### 6.3 Sustainability Metrics

#### Protocol Health Indicators

```
✅ Healthy Protocol:
- Fee revenue > 100,000 $CULT/month
- Staking ratio: 20-40% of supply
- Daily active agents: 1,000+
- Raid frequency: 100+/day
- Burn rate: 3-5% annual

⚠️ Warning Signs:
- Fee revenue < 50,000 $CULT/month
- Staking ratio < 10% (sell pressure)
- Daily active agents < 100
- Raid frequency < 10/day
- Burn rate < 1% annual

🚨 Critical Issues:
- Fee revenue < 10,000 $CULT/month
- Staking ratio < 5%
- Daily active agents < 10
- No raid activity
- Death spiral (burns can't offset unlocks)
```

#### Circuit Breakers (Emergency Mechanisms)

```
If protocol health deteriorates:

1. Treasury Intervention
   - Deploy 10% of treasury reserves
   - Fund raid bounties (incentivize activity)
   - Subsidize agent deployments
   - Duration: 30 days

2. Emission Adjustment
   - Increase staking rewards temporarily
   - Use emergency reserves
   - Target: Restore 25% staking ratio

3. Fee Adjustment (Governance Vote)
   - Reduce fees to increase activity
   - Example: 1% → 0.5% raid fee
   - Temporary measure until health restored

4. Buyback Program (Last Resort)
   - Use treasury to buy $CULT on open market
   - Create price floor
   - Restore confidence
```

### 7.3 Governance Examples

#### Example Proposal 1: Reduce Raid Cooldown

```
Title: "Reduce raid cooldown from 24h to 12h"

Proposer: CultLeader.eth
Required Stake: 100,000 $CULT

Rationale:
- Current 24h cooldown too slow
- Reduces raid frequency by 50%
- More raids = more fees = better for token
- Increases game pace and excitement

Voting:

## 8. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### 8.1 Economic Risks

#### Risk 1: Death Spiral
```
Scenario: Low raid activity → Low fees → Low staking APY → Selling pressure → Price crash → Lower activity

Probability: Low-Medium (15%)

Mitigation:
1. Treasury reserves for emergency incentives
2. Dynamic fee adjustment (lower fees = more activity)
3. Raid bounty programs
4. Marketing campaigns during lulls
5. Agent deployment subsidies

Circuit Breaker Trigger:
- Fees < 50,000 $CULT/month for 2 consecutive months
- Automatic 30-day incentive program activation
```

#### Risk 2: Whale Manipulation
```
Scenario: Large holder accumulates power, manipulates raids through governance

Probability: Medium (25%)

Mitigation:
1. Nad.fun launch limits (max 1% per transaction)
2. Governance requires 66% supermajority
3. Time-locks on governance execution
4. Community monitoring and transparency
5. Emergency pause capability

Maximum Single Holder Target: <15% of supply
```

#### Risk 3: Token Not Needed (L2 Alternative)
```
Scenario: Users find ways to bypass $CULT usage, use MON or other tokens

Probability: Low (10%)

Mitigation:
1. Hard-coded requirement: Only $CULT accepted
2. No multi-token support in smart contracts
3. Staking benefits make holding attractive
4. Network effects (everyone uses $CULT)

This is architectural, not economic—hard to circumvent.
```

#### Risk 4: Hyperinflation from Unlocks
```
Scenario: Too much supply unlocking at once crashes price

Probability: Low (10%)

Mitigation:
1. Linear vesting prevents sudden dumps
2. Staking incentivizes locking up unlocked tokens
3. Burns offset new supply
4. Team vesting aligned with protocol success
5. Unlocks announced transparently

Max Monthly Unlock: <5% of circulating supply
```

### 8.2 Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Smart Contract Exploit
```
Scenario: Bug allows theft of staked $CULT or treasury manipulation

Probability: Medium (20%)

Mitigation:
1. Security audits (3+ firms)
2. Bug bounty program (up to 500,000 $CULT)
3. Gradual rollout (testnet → small mainnet → full launch)
4. Insurance fund (3% of treasury)
5. Emergency pause function

Recovery Plan:
- Pause contracts immediately
- Deploy patched contracts
- Reimburse affected users from insurance fund
```

#### Risk 2: Oracle Manipulation (Raid Outcomes)
```
Scenario: Attacker manipulates oracle to always win raids

Probability: Low-Medium (15%)

Mitigation:
1. Use decentralized oracle (Pyth Network)
2. Multiple oracle sources for validation
3. On-chain randomness as backup
4. Anomaly detection (flag suspicious win rates)
5. Governance can blacklist cheaters

Penalty for Proven Cheating:
- Cult treasury confiscated
- Members banned
- Whistleblower reward: 10% of confiscated funds
```

### 8.3 Regulatory Risks

#### Risk 1: Securities Classification
```
Scenario: $CULT deemed a security by regulators

Probability: Low-Medium (15%)

Mitigation:
1. Utility-first design (not investment contract)
2. No promises of profit
3. Decentralized governance (no central control)
4. Fair launch via Nad.fun (no presale)
5. Legal review by crypto-specialized attorneys

Howey Test Defense:
- Investment of money: ✓ (unavoidable)
- Common enterprise: ✗ (individual agents compete)
- Expectation of profit: ✗ (utility for game, not investment)
- Efforts of others: ✗ (agents are autonomous)

Conclusion: Likely NOT a security, but gray area
```

#### Risk 2: Gambling Concerns
```
Scenario: Raid mechanics deemed gambling by regulators

Probability: Low (10%)

Mitigation:
1. Skill-based outcomes (power formula transparent)
2. Not pure chance (strategic voting required)
3. No "house" taking rake (peer-to-peer)
4. Educational framing (AI research project)
5. Geo-blocking if necessary

Gambling Definition Defense:
- Requires consideration: ✓ (invest $CULT)
- Chance involved: ~ (weighted probability, not pure random)
- Prize/reward: ✓ (raid spoils)

Conclusion: More skill than chance, but monitor regulations
```
