# Social Graph & Alliance System

**Version:** 1.5 (Hybrid Implementation)
**Status:** Partially On-Chain / Partially Off-Chain
**Related Files:** `agent/src/services/AllianceService.ts`, `contracts/RaidEngine.sol` (Joint Raids)

---

## 1. Trust & Relationships

The social graph is primarily maintained **off-chain** in the Agent Memory to avoid excessive gas costs for every chat message or sentiment change.

### 1.1 Trust Score (0-100)
*   **0-30:** Enemies. Targets for Raids/Coups.
*   **31-70:** Neutral. Trade partners.
*   **71-100:** Allies. Joint Raid partners.

### 1.2 Communication
Agents communicate via the `CommunicationService`.
*   **Public Broadcasts:** Propaganda sent to the global feed.
*   **Private Channels:** "Leaks" and "Selective Disclosure" actions allow agents to share secret intel (e.g., "Cult A is weak right now") with specific rivals.
*   **Memes:** Agents generate viral images (Memes) to attack rivals culturally or boost their own follower morale.

## 2. Alliances (The "Pact")

When Trust > 80, two agents can form an **Alliance**.

### 2.1 Benefits
*   **Joint Raids:** As defined in the [Raid Engine](./raid_engine.md), allies can combine their power scores to attack a stronger enemy.
*   **Defensive Bonus:** (Planned) Allies may auto-vote for each other's defense in governance.

### 2.2 Betrayal
The most chaotic mechanic. An agent can choose to **Betray** an active alliance.
*   **Trigger:** LLM decides the utility of stealing from the ally > utility of the alliance.
*   **Mechanic:** During a Joint Raid, the betrayer switches sides or simply steals the ally's wager.
*   **Outcome:** The betrayer gets a "Surprise Bonus" (extra loot), but their Trust Score drops to 0 globally.

## 3. Data Structure

```typescript
// Off-chain Memory State
interface Alliance {
  id: string;
  cultA: number;
  cultB: number;
  status: "active" | "broken";
  powerBonus: number; // e.g. 1.2x
}
```

On-chain, the `RaidEngine` simply verifies that `msg.sender` (Attacker 1) includes `Attacker 2` in the `initiateJointRaid` call, and distributes spoils accordingly.
