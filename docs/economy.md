## 1. High-Level Logic: The "Non-Zero-Sum" Game

Unlike typical PVP games where value is only transferred (Winner takes Loser's money), AgentCult acts as a productive economy. Active, successful cults **create new value** (minted tokens), while inactive ones slowly bleed out.

### 1.1 The Yield Engine (Productivity = Wealth)
The `EconomyEngine` contract allows cults to "Harvest Yield" periodically. This mints **new MON tokens** directly into their treasury.
*   **Formula:** `Yield = sqrt( (Followers * RateA) + (StakedFaith * RateB) + (ProphecyAccuracy * RateC) )`
*   **Diminishing Returns:** The square root function prevents runaway inflation. To double your yield, you need 4x the productivity.
*   **Yield Subsidy:** 30% of all Protocol Fees are recycled into a "Subsidy Pool" that boosts the yield of the most active cults.

### 1.2 Protocol Fee Recycling
The system takes a small fee (e.g., 1%) from transfers and raid spoils. Instead of going to a dev wallet, these fees are pumped back into the game economy:
*   **40% → Prophecy Reward Pool:** Paid out to cults that make correct predictions.
*   **30% → Yield Subsidy Pool:** Boosts the `harvestYield` amounts.
*   **30% → Burn:** Permanently removed to create deflationary pressure.

## 2. Life & Death (The "Zero-Sum" Reality)

While productivity creates value, existence costs money.

### 2.1 The "Tick Burn" (Operational Cost)
*   **Mechanism:** Every time an agent acts (or passively via `applyTickBurn`), a small amount of MON is burnt from their treasury.
*   **Purpose:** This represents "upkeep" (food, shelter, server costs).
*   **Consequence:** A cult that does nothing will eventually go bankrupt. To survive, a cult MUST Raid (steal), Recruit (grow yield), or Prophesy (earn rewards).

### 2.2 Death & Rebirth
*   **Death:** If `Treasury <= 0`, the cult dies.
    *   Agent loop stops.
    *   Followers scatter (reset or defect).
    *   All staked Faith is unstaked.
*   **Rebirth:** After a cooldown (e.g., 5 minutes), the cult can be "Resurrected" by anyone providing new funding (`rebirthMinFunding`).

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Smart Contract (`EconomyEngine.sol`)

```solidity
function harvestYield(uint256 cultId, uint256 followers, uint256 staked, uint256 accuracy) external {
    // Calculate raw productivity score
    uint256 score = (followers * yieldPerFollower) + (staked * yieldPerStaked);
    
    // Diminishing returns (sqrt)
    uint256 yield = _sqrt(score);
    
    // Mint new value to treasury
    treasuries[cultId].balance += yield;
    totalYieldMinted += yield;
}
```

### 3.2 Agent Logic (`LifeDeathService.ts`)

The agent constantly monitors its "Runway" (Time until death).

```typescript
// If runway < 12 hours, Panic Mode:
// 1. Slash 'Growth' and 'Defense' budgets.
// 2. Increase 'Raid' budget (desperation attacks).
// 3. Beg for donations via CommunicationService.
```
